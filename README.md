## containers

This is a python library for 'typed collections' -- it makes it safer & easier to work with collections (lists & dicts) of items of the same type.

### example

```
# todo
```

### compatibility

Recent python 2.x should work, python 3 not tested (probably doesn't work).

### installation

```
pip install git+ ...
```
